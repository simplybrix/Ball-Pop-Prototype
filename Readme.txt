Ball Pop! purpose:
The purpose of ball pop! is to create a working prototype that allows a player who views in 1st person to capture balls while dodging the shady enemies.
There are three total enemies who try to capture you and if caught, a menu will pop up stating you've lost and ask if you want to play again.
Will also state the highest score.

As of 10/19/2021:
The character can move around and catch the balls; each ball is 5 points and the score is correctly taken.

Next Steps:
I need to create an enemy AI (Schmowzow) that will attack my player and kill on contact.
I need to finish the development of my Game Over Screen so that when hit or all of the balls are collected, the game will end.
I need to make the fence functional so that if the character hits the fence, they don't go through and fall of the edge.

Game Mechanics:
Moving (Left, right, forward, and Back)
Jumping
Collecting balls by moving on them
