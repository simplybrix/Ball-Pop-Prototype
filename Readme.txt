Ball Pop! purpose:
The purpose of ball pop! is to create a working prototype that allows a player who views in 1st person to capture balls while dodging the shady enemies.
There are three total enemies who try to capture you and if caught, a menu will pop up stating you've lost and ask if you want to play again.
Will also state the highest score.

Game Mechanics:
Moving (Left, right, forward, and Back)
Jumping
Collecting balls by moving on them

Bugs:
The game works fine so far, but there are a few bugs.
1. The sound works great but i want to change it so that the sound works for the whole game -> google this
2. the player is not situated on top of the ground. Why?
3. the player does not jump. 
4. player moves around but not fast enough. why?

Next Tasks:
The following are my upcoming tasks.
1. fix all bugs
2. develop two spawn systems: one for balls and one for enemy (enemy will follow player's movements, balls will be stationary but will disapear after collected until respawned after 15-30 seconds)
3. Develop UI that shows score (balls popped), highest overall score, main menu, options, and directions
4.Create pop up menu for after the play button is pressed that makes the game paused or idle until the player is finished reading the instructions
5. Develop a fence around the border so the character doesn't fall off the edge
